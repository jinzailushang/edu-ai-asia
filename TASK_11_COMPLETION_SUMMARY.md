### 1. Core Analytics Infrastructure

#### Analytics Utility Module (`src/utils/analytics.ts`)
Created a comprehensive analytics utility that provides:

- **Dual Platform Support**: Simultaneous tracking to both Google Analytics 4 and Baidu Analytics
- **Event Tracking Functions**: 
  - `trackGAEvent()` - Google Analytics event tracking
  - `trackBaiduEvent()` - Baidu Analytics event tracking
  - `trackEvent()` - Combined tracking to both platforms
  
- **Convenience Functions** for common events:
  - `trackPhoneClick()` - Track phone number clicks
  - `trackEmailClick()` - Track email clicks
  - `trackWeChatClick()` - Track WeChat interactions
  - `trackWhatsAppClick()` - Track WhatsApp clicks
  - `trackCTAClick()` - Track Call-to-Action button clicks

  - `trackScrollDepth()` - Track scroll depth milestones
  - `trackFormSubmit()`, `trackFormSuccess()`, `trackFormError()` - Form tracking (ready for future use)

- **Automatic Tracking**:
  - `initScrollTracking()` - Automatically tracks 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% scroll depths
  - `initAnalytics()` - Initializes all automatic tracking on page load

### 2. Analytics Integration in Layout
